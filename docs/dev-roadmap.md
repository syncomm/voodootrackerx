# Current State Snapshot

VoodooTracker X has moved beyond the original parser and early pattern-editor
baseline. The current app has a working AppKit tracker shell, module open/load
flow, tracker-style pattern display, static highlight row behavior, stable
viewport navigation, first-pass XM playback, playback diagnostics, and an
initial deterministic software mixer skeleton.

Runtime playback still uses the `AVAudioPlayerNode` / `AVAudioUnitVarispeed`
backend. The software mixer path is groundwork for offline rendering and future
reference comparison; it can render synthetic one-shot sample voices plus
synthetic forward and ping-pong loops, volume/panning envelope foundations,
absolute-frame, row/tick scheduled, minimal synthetic pattern voices, and tiny
bounded `PlaybackSong` adapter segments through the offline harness with
source-to-synthetic diagnostics. Parsed `PlaybackInstrument.volumeEnvelope`
points can be converted into the C-backed frame-based envelope representation
for those bounded offline adapted renders only, and adapted note triggers now
carry a minimal deterministic note/sample-derived playback step. This is not
full FT2/OpenMPT pitch parity. The path does not yet render full XM song
playback or drive live playback.

# Phase 1 — Core Tracker

Goal: fully functional pattern editor.

Tasks:

- static cursor row behavior
- stable pattern viewport
- cursor field navigation
- edit mode
- row gutter alignment
- channel header alignment
- horizontal scrolling

Status: In progress

Checkpoint: Tracker Editor Static Row Milestone
- static highlight row implemented
- wrap behavior implemented
- shared viewport slot mapping implemented
- unified layout fix applied for gutter/body alignment

Current note:
- read-only tracker display, stable viewport behavior, keyboard navigation, and pattern selection are implemented
- full editing remains future work

---

# Phase 2 — Pattern Editing

Add full editing capabilities.

Features:

- note entry
- instrument entry
- effect entry
- copy/paste rows
- pattern insertion/deletion
- pattern length editing

---

# Phase 3 — Audio Engine and Playback Accuracy

Improve first-pass playback into deterministic, reference-comparable playback.

Components:

- PlaybackEngine
- PlaybackAudioEngine
- SoftwareMixer
- Playback trace diagnostics
- Audio comparison tooling

Features:

- first-pass XM playback through `AVAudioPlayerNode` / `AVAudioUnitVarispeed`
- transport, timing, pitch, loop, panning, volume-column, and envelope compatibility passes
- playback debug seek and trace export
- local reference comparison workflow against MikMod/OpenMPT
- deterministic software mixer skeleton for future offline rendering
- bounded offline render harness for deterministic mixer validation
- synthetic one-shot sample rendering through the offline mixer harness
- synthetic forward and ping-pong loop rendering through the offline mixer harness
- synthetic volume and panning envelope foundations through the C-backed offline mixer path
- synthetic absolute-frame voice scheduling through the C-backed offline mixer path
- synthetic tracker row/tick timing through the C-backed offline mixer path
- minimal synthetic pattern playback through the C-backed offline mixer path
- minimal bounded `PlaybackSong` to synthetic adapter renders through the C-backed offline mixer path
- parsed `PlaybackInstrument.volumeEnvelope` point mapping for bounded offline adapted renders, using constant initial speed/BPM only
- minimal note-to-sample-step pitch foundation for bounded offline adapted renders, without full FT2/OpenMPT parity
- ADR 005 documents that the current Swift software mixer remains the deterministic reference/specification harness while the eventual hot-path mixer moves toward a small C-compatible core behind a Swift wrapper
